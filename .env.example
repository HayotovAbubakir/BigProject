### Firebase configuration (copy to `.env` and fill values)
# If you want the app to require Firebase for auth, set VITE_ALLOW_LEGACY to `false` (default).
# To permit legacy localStorage credential fallback (not recommended), set VITE_ALLOW_LEGACY=true

# Firebase configuration removed from this project.
# No environment variables are required for local persistence.

# When set to 'true' the app will still allow legacy localStorage credentials for login/register.
# Recommended: leave empty or set to 'false' and configure Firebase.
VITE_ALLOW_LEGACY=false
